# Auktionstorget
This script defines a HouseScraper class that scrapes houses and apartments from Kronofogden's Auktionstorg, compares them to previously saved listings in a file, and updates the file with new listings if any are found. If the file doesn't exist, it fetches and saves the current listings immediately before running further comparisons.
